## PHP Boilerplate - `runPHP` code step Blueprint
Starting point for using the `runPHP` code step in a Blueprint.

This file is used to showcase what you are trying to do with the Blueprint. It can provide extra information, variable or attribute information, environmental setup, or other details that are needed to run the Blueprint.

The other parts of the PHP Boilerplate Blueprint are formatted `PHP` code and the `blueprint.json` files. These three files together make consuming a Blueprint that uses `PHP` code steps easier.
