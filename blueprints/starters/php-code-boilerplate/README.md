## PHP Boilerplate - `runPHP` code step Blueprint
Starting point for using the `runPHP` code step in a Blueprint.

This folder is used to showcase what you are trying to do with the Blueprint. It can provide extra information, variable or attribute information, environmental setup, or other details that are needed to run the Blueprint.

As we are sharing Blueprints with each other, it will be important to also share the context of why the blueprint is needed. Providing this additional information will help all parties to identify common ground in blueprint design, and also help to troubleshoot issues in blueprints if they arise. 

Additional files:
- `README.md` - This file provides the context for the Blueprint and any additional information needed to run the Blueprint.
- `code.php` - Code blocks of `PHP` separated by comments and with correct formatting.

Required files:
- `blueprint.json` - This file provides the structure of the Blueprint and the steps that are needed to run the Blueprint.

The only file necessary here is the `blueprint.json` file, the other files are for documentation and reference purposes.
