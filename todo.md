As a baseline understanding for these docs, the files included here are Markdown files that are mostly "index" style with links to various resources. In many cases, starting content is ready for many sections under each page. 

### Searching for items to work on

For items needed, you can search the entire repo for `Todo:` to find items that need to be completed. Otherwise, checkboxes have been used as well, which can be found by searching the repo for `[ ]`.

- Screenshots are needed for many pages, search "screenshot" to find these items.
- Most items are top-level headings and need an excerpt and examples. Links to more info if pertinent.
