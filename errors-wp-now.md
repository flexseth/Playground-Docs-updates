## Security warnings
Sometimes when you use packages from an external source, the project you are using needs to update them. This can happen quite often with `NPM` packages.

See the [Security Warnings](./playground-tools/wp-now/fixing-security-warnings.md) page for more information on how to audit and fix security issues in `wp-now`.

You can report these types of errors if you aren't able to get them fixed.
Here is a sample error report on the `playground-tools` repo
- [wp-now: Resolve npm audit warnings #224](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/issues/224)
- [ ] TODO: Update docs with how to audit and fix security issues in `wp-now`
