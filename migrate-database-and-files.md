Migrating a WordPress website by moving the database and files has been a long-standing way to move a WordPress website from one server to another. This process involves exporting the database and files from the source server and importing them into the destination server. 

## Limitations
`wp-now` does not support the `shell` step type. This means that you cannot run shell commands in `wp-now`.

If the import/export method you're looking to use needs to run shell commands, you'll need to use a different method to migrate your website.

Here's a blueprint example, with the accompanying files to accomplish a website migration this way. 

## Autogenerated pseudocode below...

```json
{
  "name": "Migrate Database and Files",
  "description": "Migrate a WordPress website by moving the database and files.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Export database",
      "description": "Export the database from the source server.",
      "type": "runPHP",
      "code": "<?php echo 'Export database'; ?>"
    },
    {
      "name": "Export files",
      "description": "Export the files from the source server.",
      "type": "runPHP",
      "code": "<?php echo 'Export files'; ?>"
    },
    {
      "name": "Import database",
      "description": "Import the database into the destination server.",
      "type": "runPHP",
      "code": "<?php echo 'Import database'; ?>"
    },
    {
      "name": "Import files",
      "description": "Import the files into the destination server.",
      "type": "runPHP",
      "code": "<?php echo 'Import files'; ?>"
    }
  ]
}
```
