## Describe the bug
<--! What did you encounter that seems to be broken? -->

## What protocol is used with the blueprint?
[Query API](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/apis-overview#query-api)
[JavaScript API](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/apis-overview#javascript-api)

## Blueprint or no?
Did you send a custom blueprint to the instance, or just boot up as-is?
<!-- 

Yes, I used a custom blueprint: 
- link to blueprint URL (GitHub, SVN, publicly accessible link)
- or replace these lines with Blueprint code attached from below

No - I went to a URL pointing to a fragment on playground.wordpress.net 
If you didn't use a custom blueprint: 
- write no custom blueprint and
- explain user flow for how you got to this link
- Please link to the Issue, Pull Request, or discussion around the link with fragment


-->

## paste blueprint as `JSON` code below
The best practice is to copy directly from the code editor, this will retain formatting and readibility in most cases. 

If there are formatting issues, you can use a `JSON` code formatter like https://jsonformatter.org/
Please copy/paste your blueprint from a code editor, which will retain spacing

Once copy pasted below, you can delete all of these instructions. 
It should be just the the `JSON` code directly below the bold sub-section above.
<!--

```JSON

```

-->

If you chose **No** above - you did not have a blueprint...
Please delete the entire previous section to help keep the issue clean.


## Journey to reproduce issue
1. Go to '...'

3. What happened
4. See errors - if applicable

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Screenshots or screencast

## Include Console errors
<!-- - 
Copy/paste the error into this section 

-->
Please include the error you see in the console in a code block. 

Best practices for console log reporting
- Try to track down to as close as possible where the error is occuring
- If there are multiple errors occuring, show them separately
- It shouldn't be a ton of info per error, just the stack trace
- Include code samples wrapped in `SHELL` code blocks


### SHELL code blocks
<code>\`\`\`SHELL 
{error codes} 
\`\`\`</code>
