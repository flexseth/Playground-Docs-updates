Thank you for helping document WordPress Playground!

If you don't know what Playground is, skim over this [Introduction to Playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/04/05/introduction-to-playground-running-wordpress-in-the-browser/) and the [Start Here](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/) documentation page.

Then read [Contributing to Playground Documentation](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/contributing/documentation/). Playground documentation is written in markdown and lives at https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/tree/trunk/packages/docs/site/docs. Your contributions in form of Pull Requests are the most appreciated.
