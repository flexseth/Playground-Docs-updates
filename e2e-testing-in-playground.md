> What types of tests are considered end-to-end tests?

End-to-end tests are tests that verify the functionality of an application from start to finish. They are designed to simulate real user scenarios and interactions with the application. End-to-end tests typically involve multiple components of the application and test the application as a whole.

Instructions for testing are as follows:
1. Start Playground  
2. import the blueprint
3. It's installing software packages
4. It's running the blueprint
5. Tests are ran, reports generated
6. It's done - send report
