## Index pages
Top level pages that contain many sub pages should include the page title as a `h2`, and a brief excerpt of the sub-pages included. If there are less than three sub-pages it is OK to provide a list of the subpages, with links, signified by a `li` tag with links. 

If the sub-pages are numerous, consider using a table of contents.
