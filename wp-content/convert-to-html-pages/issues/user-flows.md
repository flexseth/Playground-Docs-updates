## How did the user encounter the issue?

I am still testing playground. Now I have a problem with some sql queries. Those queries fails inside playground but works in MariaDB. Is there a preferred path/tool to debug this? Which are limitations to sql statements usable inside playground. Any link or hint, really appreciated:smile:
