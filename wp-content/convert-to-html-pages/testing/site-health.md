## Site Health reports
The site health feature is now enabled in Playground ðŸŽ‰ You can try it out here:

https://playground.wordpress.net/?networking=yes&url=/wp-admin/site-health.php?tab=debug


## Known Limitations
The support is not full yet as Playground does not support PHP making HTTP requests to itself (e.g. wp_safe_remote_get("https://playground.wordpress.net/scope:0.0875753914918784/index.php?rest_route=%2Fwp%2Fv2%2Ftypes%2Fpost&context=edit"), which is something the Site Health report does. Once that feature is supported, the site health report should be fully functional.

This isn't directly related to the core of this issue which is to start Playground based on an existing site health report, but I felt it was relevant to share here anyway.
