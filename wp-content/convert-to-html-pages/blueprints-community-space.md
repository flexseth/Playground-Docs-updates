## Background
The Blueprints Community Space is a place for users to share their blueprints, ask questions, and collaborate on new ideas.

In a best case scenario, the community space can read a blueprint and categorize it with other blueprints that do similar things. For example: 
- `runPHP` step - showcase using native WordPress functions
- `runPHP` step - showcase using custom PHP functions
- `options` step - showcase using `options` in a step

## Features: Buttons
- Try out blueprint - (opens in playground.wordpress.net)
- Download blueprint - Download the blueprint as a JSON file

etc...
