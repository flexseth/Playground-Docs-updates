## About CORS
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 

It is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. However, this can lead to unintended consequences.
