## Docs via the Gutenberg Block Editor
Pages here were created in Markdown. The rationale is that Markdown can be pasted into the Block Editor and converted to HTML. 

Markdown is a great syntax for creating
- headings
- intro content (excerpts)
- links - to other documentation, to external resources
- source code

... which allows it to be a great source to enter into the block editor. 

### About pages in this directory
- Each page is a Markdown file
- Pages can be pasted into the Block Editor to create a docs page
- Contributors can then edit the page in the block editor
- PRs can then be used to update the docs (see workflow below)

### How to contribute
A best practice is to create an individual branch for the page you want to work on.
- [ ] TODO: Add steps to contribute...


### Taxonomy
Finally, add taxonomy to your post so it can be properly categorized and tagged.
- [ ] TODO: Add snippets for the following
- include the `post-tags` block  
- include the `post-categories` block

Add this to the end of your post so the information can be processed correctly.

The Playground Plugin will handling parsing the content when imported to WordPress.
